In this post, we want to bring you up to speed on what is happening inside Steemit, as well as give you our perspective on the successes (and failures) of the past year, let you know what we see as our mission going forward, and provide some insight into what we have planned.
<h1>Steemit’s Vision and Mission</h1>
Through our vision of **empowering entrepreneurs to tokenize the internet**, our primary roles in the Steem ecosystem are providing the community with software enhancements to the Steem blockchain, modular framework applications made up of components that can be leveraged by application developers and inspiration through these platforms to entrepreneurial end-users. We believe we must build in ways that create as many opportunities — and catalyze as many amazing Steem-based entrepreneurs and communities — as possible.`
